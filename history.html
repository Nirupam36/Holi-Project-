        <h2>Origin and Significance of Holi</h2>
        <p>
            Holi, the festival of colors, is one of the most popular and ancient festivals celebrated in India. It marks the arrival of spring and symbolizes the victory of good over evil. The festival is associated with various legends from Hindu mythology.
        </p>

        <h2>Legend of Prahlad and Holika</h2>
        <p>
            One of the most well-known stories linked to Holi is that of Prahlad and Holika. Prahlad was a devout follower of Lord Vishnu, but his father, King Hiranyakashipu, was a demon king who wanted to be worshipped as a god. Enraged by Prahlad’s devotion to Vishnu, Hiranyakashipu tried to kill him multiple times but failed.

        <p>
            Finally, the king’s sister, Holika, who had a magical fireproof cloak, sat with Prahlad in a burning pyre, expecting to burn him alive. However, the cloak flew from Holika and protected Prahlad instead. Holika burned to ashes, while Prahlad was saved, symbolizing the triumph of good over evil. This event is commemorated with Holika Dahan, a bonfire held on the eve of Holi.
        </p>

        <h2>Krishna and Radha’s Playful Colors</h2>
        <p>
            Another famous legend associated with Holi is that of Lord Krishna and Radha. Young Krishna, who had a dark complexion, was worried that Radha and other girls in Vrindavan would not like him. His mother, Yashoda, playfully suggested he apply colors on Radha’s face, which he did. This playful act of applying colors became a tradition, making Holi a festival of love and joy.
        </p>

        <h2>Modern Celebration</h2>
        <p>
            Today, Holi is celebrated with colors, music, dance, and sweets. People smear each other with vibrant colors, throw water balloons, and enjoy festive delicacies like <strong>gujiya</strong> and <strong>thandai</strong>. It is a festival that brings people together, regardless of caste, creed, or background, spreading happiness and harmony.
